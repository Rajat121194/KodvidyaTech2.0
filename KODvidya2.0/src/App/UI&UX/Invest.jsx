          Why You Should Invest IN Web Design?
        </h2>

        <p className="text-xl text-blue font-Sans mb-10 max-w-3xl">
          Making an honest investment in web design has a direct impact on the
          success of your company. A well-designed website improves user
          experience, makes a good first impression, and performs better in
          search engine optimizationâ€”all of which increase traffic and
          conversions. Additionally, it provides brand consistency, offers a
          competitive advantage, and increases client loyalty and trust.
